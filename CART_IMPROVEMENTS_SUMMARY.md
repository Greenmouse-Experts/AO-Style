## Technical Implementation Details

### Modal State Management
```jsx
// Simplified modal flow in ShopDetails.jsx
const handleAddToCart = () => {
  const item = localStorage.getItem("cart_id");
  if (item) {
    setIsModalSubmitOpen(true);
    localStorage.removeItem("cart_id");
  } else {
    setIsModalOpen(true);
  }
};

// Direct callback on successful cart addition
addCartMutate(payload, {
  onSuccess: () => {
    handleAddToCart();
  },
});
```

### Enhanced CheckModal Component
```jsx
// Added success messaging and better UX
<div className="w-16 h-16 bg-green-100 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center mx-auto mb-4">
  <CheckCircle className="w-8 h-8 text-green-600" />
</div>
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">
  Added to Cart!
</h2>
```

### Green Pricing Theme
```jsx
// Consistent green pricing across desktop and mobile
<span className="text-green-600 font-semibold">
  {formatPrice(unitPrice)}
</span>
```

### Policy Integration
```jsx
// Main cart page policy checkbox
<div className="flex items-start gap-3 mb-4 p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg">
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    checked={agreedToPolicy}
    onChange={(e) => setAgreedToPolicy(e.target.checked)}
    className="mt-1 h-4 w-4 text-green-600 focus:ring-green-500"
