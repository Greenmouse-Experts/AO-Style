# Google Authentication Debug Guide

## Issues Fixed & Testing Instructions

### üîç Problems Identified & Solutions

#### 1. **"Access denied: Invalid role '[object Object]'" Error**
- **Issue**: User role was being stored as an object instead of string
- **Fix**: Added role type checking and conversion to string
- **Location**: `src/modules/Auth/hooks/useGoogleSignIn.jsx`

#### 2. **User Store Not Populated After Google Signin**
- **Issue**: `useCarybinUserStore` was not being populated with user data
- **Fix**: Added proper user data structure matching regular login flow
- **Location**: `src/modules/Auth/hooks/useGoogleSignIn.jsx`

#### 3. **Session Manager Missing User Data**
- **Issue**: SessionManager only stored tokens, not user information
- **Fix**: Updated to store user data and role information
- **Location**: `src/services/SessionManager.js`

#### 4. **"My Account" Redirect to Login**
- **Issue**: User profile wasn't being fetched after Google auth
- **Fix**: Added query invalidation to trigger profile refetch
- **Location**: `src/modules/Auth/hooks/useGoogleSignIn.jsx`

## üêõ Debug Console Logs

When testing, check browser console for these log messages:

### **Successful Google Auth Logs:**
```
üîê Login: Google signin initiated Token received
üöÄ Google Auth: Starting authentication with payload: {...}
‚úÖ Google Auth: Success response: {...}
üìä Google Auth: Response structure: {...}
üîß Google Auth: Processed role: user string
‚úÖ Google Auth: User data stored in store: {...}
üîÑ Google Auth: Triggering profile refetch

## üîß Environment Setup

### **Required Environment Variables:**
```
VITE_GOOGLE_LOGIN=your_google_oauth_client_id
VITE_APP_CaryBin_API_URL=your_backend_api_url
```

### **Google OAuth Configuration:**
- Ensure your Google OAuth client ID is properly configured
- Check that your domain is added to authorized origins
- Verify redirect URIs are correctly set

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **If Google Auth Still Fails:**

1. **Check Network Tab**
   - Look for failed API calls to `/auth/sso`
   - Check if tokens are being sent in headers

2. **Check Application Tab (Dev Tools)**
   - Verify cookies are being set: `token`, `currUserUrl`, `approvedByAdmin`
   - Check Local Storage for any corrupted data

3. **Check Console Errors**
   - Look for JavaScript errors during auth flow
   - Check for CORS issues

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Role Still Shows as Object:**
- Check backend response structure
- Verify API returns role as string, not object

#### **User Data Not Persisting:**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check if `useGetUserProfile` is being called
- Verify API authentication headers

#### **Redirect Loop:**
- Check `currUserUrl` cookie value
- Verify protected routes are working correctly
- Check SessionManager auth state

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### **Before Deploying:**
1. Test all Google auth flows thoroughly
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with different user roles
4. Check mobile responsiveness of auth flow

### **Production Checklist:**
- [ ] Google OAuth client ID configured for production domain
- [ ] All redirect URIs updated for production
- [ ] Error logging configured for monitoring
- [ ] Rate limiting considered for auth endpoints
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all auth flows

## üìû Support

If issues persist after following this guide:

1. Check console logs and network tab
2. Verify all environment variables
3. Test with different browsers/incognito mode
4. Check backend API logs for auth endpoint errors

For role-related errors, focus on the user data structure in the backend response.
For session persistence issues, check the SessionManager and cookie configuration.
