# Session Management and UI Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to session management, admin banner visibility, and chat interface theming across the AO-Style application.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Session Management - Token Refresh Interval ⏰

**Issue**: Token refresh was happening every 30 seconds, causing excessive server requests.

**Solution**: Extended the refresh interval to 1 hour for better performance and reduced server load.

**File Modified**: `/src/services/SessionManager.js`

**Change Made**:
```javascript
// Before
}, 30000); // Check every 30 seconds

// After  
}, 3600000); // Check every 1 hour (3600000 ms)
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced server load by 120x (from 120 requests/hour to 1 request/hour)
- Improved application performance
- Maintained security while optimizing resource usage
- Users remain authenticated for appropriate duration

### 2. Admin Banner Visibility Fix 🛡️

**Issue**: Admin users were sometimes seeing the verification banner when they shouldn't.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient admin detection logic that didn't account for all admin indicators.

**Solution**: Enhanced admin detection with multiple validation sources.

**File Modified**: `/src/AppWrapper.jsx`

**Improvements Made**:

#### Enhanced `isAdminUser()` Function:
```javascript
const isAdminUser = () => {
  const userTypeUrl = getCookie("currUserUrl");
  const adminToken = Cookies.get("adminToken");
  const currentPath = window.location.pathname;

  // Check multiple indicators of admin status
  return (
    userTypeUrl === "admin" ||
    userTypeUrl === "super-admin" ||
    !!adminToken ||
    currentPath.includes("/admin") ||
    userType === "owner-super-administrator" ||
    userType === "owner-administrator"
  );
};
```

#### Enhanced Banner Visibility Logic:
```javascript
const shouldShowBanner =
  needsVerification &&
  !isAdminUser() &&
  !window.location.pathname.includes("/settings") &&
  !window.location.pathname.includes("/admin") &&
  !Cookies.get("adminToken") &&
  isLoggedIn &&
  (userType === "tailor" ||
    userType === "fabric" ||
    userType === "logistics" ||
    userType === "customer");
```

**Safety Checks Added**:
- ✅ Cookie-based admin token detection
- ✅ URL path checking for `/admin` routes
- ✅ Multiple user role verification
- ✅ Cross-reference validation

### 3. Chat Interface Theme Unification 🎨

**Issue**: Chat pages had inconsistent theming - some used blue while customer used purple.

**Solution**: Standardized all chat interfaces to use purple theme matching the customer dashboard.

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/modules/Pages/fabricDashboard/components/InboxPage.jsx`
- `/src/modules/Pages/logisticsDashboard/components/InboxPage.jsx`
- `/src/modules/Pages/salesDashboard/components/InboxPage.jsx`

**Theme Changes Applied**:

#### Color Mappings:
- `bg-blue-500` → `bg-purple-500`
- `bg-blue-600` → `bg-purple-600`
- `bg-blue-50` → `bg-purple-50`
- `text-blue-100` → `text-purple-100`
- `border-blue-500` → `border-purple-500`
- `ring-blue-500` → `ring-purple-500`

#### UI Elements Updated:
1. **Loading Spinners**: Blue → Purple
2. **Retry Buttons**: Blue → Purple  
3. **Search Input Focus**: Blue → Purple
4. **Selected Chat Background**: Blue → Purple
5. **Sent Message Bubbles**: Blue → Purple
6. **Message Text Colors**: Blue → Purple
7. **Send Button**: Blue → Purple
8. **Mobile Show Conversations Button**: Blue → Purple

## Visual Consistency Achieved

### Before:
- **Customer Dashboard**: Purple theme ✓
- **Admin Dashboard**: Custom theme ✓
- **Fabric Dashboard**: Blue theme ❌
- **Logistics Dashboard**: Blue theme ❌
- **Sales Dashboard**: Blue theme ❌

### After:
- **Customer Dashboard**: Purple theme ✓
- **Admin Dashboard**: Custom theme ✓
- **Fabric Dashboard**: Purple theme ✓
- **Logistics Dashboard**: Purple theme ✓
- **Sales Dashboard**: Purple theme ✓
- **Tailor Dashboard**: Purple theme ✓

## Technical Benefits
